# [v0.1.8](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.8) - 27 Oct 2021

- `syntect-printer` supports text-wrapping. Longer lines than terminal width are now wrapped by default. It can handle wide characters including special emojis with zero-width joiner (U+200D) like üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶

- `syntect-printer` highlights matched regions in matched lines with a searched text color. Since match positions in matched lines are not included in output from `grep -nH`, currently this is only supported by combination of `syntect-printer` feature and `ripgrep` feature
- `syntect-printer` now uses light dashed lines for the separator of snippets: `‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂‚ï∂`
- Add `--wrap MODE` option where `MODE` is one of `char` or `never` (the default value is `char`). More modes may be implemented in the future
- In favor of `--wrap` option, `--no-wrap` flag is now deprecated and will be removed at v0.2.0. Use `--wrap never` instead
- When building binaries for Windows, link C runtime statically. This avoid depending on vcruntime DLL at runtime
- Critical section of `syntect-printer` was optimized. It slightly improved performance (around 4% faster in benchmarks)
- Enable thin LTO for release build. It slightly improved performance (0~6% faster in benchmarks)

# [v0.1.7](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.7) - 24 Oct 2021

- Fix highlighting was broken on 256 colors terminals when using `bat-printer`.
- `bat-printer` enables text wrapping by default as `bat` command does. `--no-wrap` can disable text wrapping.
- `bat-printer` now looks at bat's cache directory when `--custom-assets` flag is given. This is useful if you use some custom syntax highlighting or theme. Note that this may not work fine with some versions of `bat` command.
- `bat-printer` automatically uses 'ansi' theme for terminals which enable only 16 colors since other themes don't work.
- Add `--terminal-width` option to give the width of terminal explicitly. This is useful when piping the results to other command like `less`.
- Fix build failure due to lack of assets (#4).
- Fix some newlines were missing when printing results with `syntect-printer`.
- Use `terminal_size` crate directly instead of using `console` crate. It removes 3 dependencies when `bat-printer` feature is not enabled.
- The document has been improved. Especially if you like a pager such as `less`, I recommend to check ['Set default command options'](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep#set-default-command-options) section.
- (Dev) Several tests and benchmarks for `syntect-printer` were added.

<a name="v0.1.6"></a>
# [v0.1.6](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.6) - 23 Oct 2021

- Add new experimental `syntect-printer` feature built with [syntect](https://github.com/trishume/syntect) library.
  - It is much faster than current printer built on bat (2x~4x faster).
  - Its output layout is optimized for our use case. For example, line numbers at matches are highlighted in different color.
  - It supports painting background colors with `--background` flag. This is useful when your favorite theme does not fit to your terminal's background color.
  - See [`bat` printer v.s. `syntect` printer](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep#bat-printer-vs-syntect-printer) section for comparison of the two printers.
- Add `--printer` (`-p`) flag to specify printer to use. It takes argument `bat` or `syntect`. `-p syntect` enables the new experimental printer
- `bat` printer is now optional through `bat-printer` feature gate. Note that at least `bat-printer` or `syntect-printer` must be enabled. Both printers are enabled by default. See [Feature flags](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep#feature-flags) section for more details.
- hgrep is now available for NetBSD. See [the instruction](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep#for-netbsd) (thanks @0323pin, #3)

# [v0.1.5](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.5) - 20 Oct 2021

- Always use a relative path in header of output
- Fix an output is broken due to ANSI color sequence on Windows

# [v0.1.4](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.4) - 19 Oct 2021

- Fix compile error on `cargo install` due to new release of `clap` crate v3.0.0-beta.5 (#2)
- Add how to install `hgrep` command with [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org/). See [the document](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep#via-macports) for more details (thanks @herbygillot, #1)

[Changes][v0.1.4]


<a name="v0.1.3"></a>
# [v0.1.3](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.3) - 19 Oct 2021

- Heuristics on calculating context lines is 1.3x faster by using optimized [memchr](https://docs.rs/memchr/2.4.1/memchr/) implementation when the searched file is large
- [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) is now supported for managing `hgrep` command on macOS or Linux. See [the installation instruction](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep#via-homebrew) for more details
- Add `--grid` flag as an opposite of `--no-grid` flag
- Add [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) which describes the development of this project
- (Dev) Add [some benchmark suites](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep/tree/main/hgrep-bench) for each parts of this program to track performance

[Changes][v0.1.3]


<a name="v0.1.2"></a>
# [v0.1.2](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.2) - 17 Oct 2021

- Fix printing tab characters. Now default tab width is 4 (can be configured with `--tab` option).
- Fix exit status is always 0 when no error happens. Grep tool should return non-zero exit status when no match was found.
- Add feature to generate shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, and Elvish. Check `--generate-completion-script` option.
- Printing results is now much faster. It is [3.3x faster than previous](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep/commit/8655b801b40f8b3f7d4d343cae185604fa918d5b).
