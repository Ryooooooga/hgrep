# [v0.1.2](https://github.com/rhysd/batgrep/releases/tag/v0.1.2) - 17 Oct 2021

- Fix printing tab characters. Now default tab width is 4 (can be configured with `--tab` option).
- Fix exit status is always 0 when no error happens. Grep tool should return non-zero exit status when no match was found.
- Add feature to generate shell completion scripts for Bash, Zsh, Fish, PowerShell, and Elvish. Check `--generate-completion-script` option.
- Printing results is now much faster. It is [3.3x faster than previous](https://github.com/rhysd/hgrep/commit/8655b801b40f8b3f7d4d343cae185604fa918d5b).
